Simple web app, using c# for backend and vue.js for frontent<br /><br />


# Task<br />
Create a small web application that allows a user to receive weather,
timezone and astronomy information related to a city of their choosing

The application should have a simple UI to allow the user to select a single city from a list of 3 and to then see the weather associated with that city.
Chose any 3 cities you wish for the available cities for the user to select.
The UI should preferably use Vuejs, angular or react

Use the weather API found here

https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/timezone.json?q={city}

https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/current.json?q=dublin

https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/astronomy.json?q=dublin


Use the X-RapidAPI-Key ‘**************************’
